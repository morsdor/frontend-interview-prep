please continue. make code changes directly in file

I want you to create a nextjs that solves my problem of preparing for senior level frontend engineer who has been working on react, redux and architechting frontend applications for 5+years. I want to prepare for top companies like Amazon, Micrososoft, Atlassian, Google, Paypal, ServiceNow, JPMoragn etc,This app should have all the level of intyerview 
Level 1 - Javascript and Typescript - beginner, intermediate, and adbacnced interview questions as well as answer. Also, provide a small runtime to run JS or TS code. (Around 100+ problems)
Level 2 - React, Redux, RTK Query - internediate and advanced questiuons and answers. (Around 50+ problems)
Level 3 - A set of 15 componet design both High level with proper design (Flowcharta and how component behaves) ad well as the low level actual code that I can view in the app. These componenet can be tested and run in this app
Level 4 -a Advanced arcchiterical questions and answers including frontend sytsem design that can help me outshine my interviews. Include backedn quesrions as weel that might be required (Around 50+ problems)
Level 5 - Add questions on how internet works, how a web page loads, security and best practices, performance optimization and other included and similar topics. (Around 50+problems)

Discuss in detail and provide accurate questions and answerts. Make this app a one stop shop for all the frontend related interview questions and answers required to ace a senior frontend enginner interview at top companies. Add anything extra that you think should make the app even better

Each question page should have 3 parts - 
problem statement and problem requirement with an example maybe 
Another part should contain a code editor for js where i can type in code and execute it and see console output
Last part should contain solution in markdown code and a proper explanation for that
Remember this step for all the question page to be created. It would be better not to use state or effect code that can cause to use "use client" directive

Now start adding more questions under  javascript/questions folder. make interesting questions and answers that challenge users.  add each question under individual folder and also add that reference to the questions.ts file
